/**
 `AirTurnViewManager` manages this `AirTurnView` class automatically; using `AirTurnView` directly allows you to manage the virtual keyboard and first responder control however you want.  `AirTurnKeyboardManager` is provided to help you control the virtual keyboard should you wish to take that approach.  You can achieve everything that `AirTurnViewManager` does through the public interfaces provided in this header and `AirTurnKeyboardManager`.
 
 If you use AirTurnView directly do not use the AirTurnViewManager class at all as the first time you use the AirTurnViewManager class it assumes control over the shared AirTurnView instance.
 
 This class has a singleton method.  You should use this to obtain the shared instance of the `AirTurnView`.  I can see no real need to have more than one instance of `AirTurnView`, but if you do create multiple instances it should not cause any problems.
